## MVVM Clean Architecture with Jetpack Compose
This repository follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Clean Architecture pattern using Jetpack Compose for building modern and maintainable Android apps.

### Architecture Overview

The project is organized into different layers:

- **Presentation Layer (UI)**: This layer is responsible for displaying data on the UI using Jetpack Compose. It consists of composable functions that describe the UI based on the current state.

- **Domain Layer**: The domain layer contains the business logic and defines the use cases and business rules of the application. It is independent of any specific UI framework or data source.

- **Data Layer**: The data layer handles data access and repository implementations. It provides an abstraction to the domain layer for retrieving and manipulating data from various sources, such as remote APIs or local databases.

### Key Features

- **Separation of Concerns**: MVVM Clean Architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for easier code maintenance, testing, and reusability.

- **Dependency Inversion**: The architecture promotes the dependency inversion principle, ensuring that high-level modules do not depend on low-level modules directly. Instead, both layers depend on abstractions, leading to a more flexible and decoupled codebase.

- **Declarative UI with Jetpack Compose**: Jetpack Compose is used as the UI toolkit, providing a declarative approach to building modern UIs. Compose simplifies UI development and makes it easier to manage the UI state.

### Benefits

- **Testability**: The separation of concerns and dependency inversion in MVVM Clean Architecture allows for easier unit testing of individual components, making it convenient to test business logic and UI separately.

- **Modularity**: The architecture promotes modular development, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the codebase.

- **Maintainability**: With a clear separation of responsibilities, the codebase becomes more maintainable and easier to understand, reducing the effort required for bug fixing and adding new features.

### Getting Started
